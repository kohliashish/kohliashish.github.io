      <description>In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, large language models (LLMs) have become a significant trend across various industries. Businesses are increasingly exploring their potential, from enhancing customer service with chatbots to automating content generation and analyzing vast amounts of data. Despite their cutting-edge capabilities, the practical applications of LLMs in business are still relatively nascent and often limited to high-profile use cases.&#xA;One promising and practical application of LLMs is in the realm of database optimization.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this project, I set out to explore image similarity using deep learning. Leveraging the power of Keras, I aimed to detect similarities between images using a Pokémon image dataset from Kaggle. The idea was simple: take a pre-trained ResNet50 model, process Pokémon images into their vector forms, and then compare these vectors with an image of myself. The results? You&amp;rsquo;ll see soon enough.&#xA;The Dataset and Approach For this project, I used a Pokémon images dataset available on Kaggle.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.&amp;rdquo; — Lao Tzu&#xA;Yes, you read that one right! One of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms out there is Linear Regression. In simple words, it is a technique to describe a relationship between a response(a.k.a dependent) variable and one or more explanatory (a.k.a independent) variable(s). After doing some reading into the “math” behind these algorithms, I realized that this can be easily achieved in SQL.</description>
